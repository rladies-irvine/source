Hi everyone!

We're going to kick off the 2018-19 academic year with an Intro to R tutorial! Per your requests, our co-organizers will show you:

- how to navigate R and RStudio
- how to manipulate and sort dataframes with base R and dplyr
- how to find helpful R learning resources
- and much more!

Please bring your laptops and have R, RStudio, and the tidyverse package (all open-source and free) installed and working. However, if you're having issues with any of these, don't worry! We're all here to help. :)
