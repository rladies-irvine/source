Hi everyone!

This month's meeting will be a social at UTC, where we'll socialize, network, and hang out.

There will be no formal technical talks at this meeting; instead, this time will be used to network and exchange ideas with fellow R-Ladies.

Schedule

7:00pm - 8:30pm: Socializing/Networking/Hanging out + Group Picture

Additional friends and family members are welcome to attend.

Parking at UTC is free. :)
