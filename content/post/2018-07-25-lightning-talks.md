Hi everyone!

This month's meeting will be a series of lightning talks given by **you!**

In this fun, informal setting, participants will have approximately 5-10 minutes (length depending on number of responses) to speak about their research, work, or a puzzle they’re trying to solve with R – anything goes! Our goals are to (1) provide a space to learn about others in our community and (2) exchange ideas about the methodologies, interests, and tools we all are using.

Please fill out [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/Ct87SA3mc3HV8jc73) if you'd like to participate and give a lightning talk!
