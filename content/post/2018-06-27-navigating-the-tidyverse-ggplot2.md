Hi everyone!

As tutorials on packages (specifically the tidyverse, and in particular, ggplot2) were the most popular requests in our survey, this meeting will be a workshop exploring the wonders of ggplot2!

Please bring your laptops and have R, RStudio, and the tidyverse package installed and working. However, if you're having issues with any of these, don't worry! We're all here to help. :)

What is ggplot2?
